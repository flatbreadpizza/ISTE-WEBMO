        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Within my research, I intend to answer some of the following  questions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How does it compare to other AI models? </li>
            <li>What makes it so advanced?</li>
            <li>What are its limitations and how can they be addressed?</li>
            <li>Is there a contribution to the open source community?</li>
        </ul>

                I chose this topic for research because I am interested in AI.
                It is becoming increasingly popular in code creation and has grown in relevance in the medical field, translations,
                game development, and content creation. These are only a few of the areas in which LLMs have taken unprecedented strides in.

            <h2>Intentions Of Research</h2>
                <p>
                    With this research, I intend to dive into the quickly growing Deepseek,
                    Deepseek is another Large language model, which is, to trivialize it heavily,
                    is an interactable database containing an unimaginable amount of content from the internet.
                    A user inputs a prompt, and then, based on the data it has, learns and recognizes patterns and then
                    does a highly complicated amount of math to guess what should reasonably be the response to the prompt.
                    Based on its training data, it learns to imitate specific patterns it's seen to add to its response.
                    They have a lot of power, but as it stands right now, they have a few limitations.
