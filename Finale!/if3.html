    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        The Finger Lakes have an extremely rich history, but that being said
        we cannot forget about the history of the people that lived on the land before us
        and the hardships they faced. The conditions of the lands in our modern day can really
        be attributed to the care by the Native American population.


    </p>

    <p>
        The Finger Lakes region has been home to the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) for over 10,000 years,
        comprising the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and later the Tuscarora nations.
        Each lake holds specific significance:
    </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Seneca Lake: Heartland of the Seneca Nation,
                    who called it “the place of the stone”.
                    Key sites include Ganondagan State Historic Site
                    (Seneca “Town of Peace”) and Catherine’s Town (near Watkins Glen),
                    destroyed during the <a href ="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-clinton-sullivan-campaign-of-1779.htm#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%20the,loss%20of%20only%2040%20men.">1779 Sullivan Expedition.</a>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Cayuga Lake: Central to the Cayuga Nation,
                    with settlements like Chonodote (Aurora) and
                    Goiogouen (Cayuga Castle).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Canandaigua Lake: Birthplace of the Seneca,
                    known as “the Chosen Place”. The 1794 Canandaigua Treaty between the U.S.
                    and Haudenosaunee is a landmark agreement.
                </li>

                <li>Keuka, Honeoye, and Conesus Lakes: Part of Seneca hunting and fishing territories,
                    with seasonal villages along shores.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Skaneateles, Owasco, Otisco, Hemlock, and Canadice Lakes:
                    Within broader Haudenosaunee influence, used for transportation and
                    resource gathering.
                </li>
